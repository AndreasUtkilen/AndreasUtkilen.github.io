# Welcome to My AI Learning Blog

One way to improve your learning is to blog about what you've learned and how you've solved problems. This blog is my space to do exactly that.

As I go through the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) course, I'll document my journey, share my solutions, and reflect on the concepts I'm exploring.

This blog also serves as a practical way to learn and use Git and GitHub by maintaining and publishing content regularly.

Stay tuned for updates on:

- What I’m learning from the fastai course
- How I solve various problems along the way
- Tips and resources I find helpful
- Projects I’m building using AI

Thanks for visiting!
