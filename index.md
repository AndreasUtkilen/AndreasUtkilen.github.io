<h1>Welcome to My AI Learning Blog</h1>
<p>
One way to improve your learning is to blog about what you've learned and how you've solved problems. This blog is my space to do exactly that.

As I go through the ELEC4630 and [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) courses, I'll document my journey, share my solutions, and reflect on the concepts I'm exploring.

This blog also serves as a practical way to learn and use Git and GitHub by maintaining and publishing content regularly.

Stay tuned for updates on:

- What I’m learning from the fastai course
- How I solve various problems along the way
- Tips and resources I find helpful
- Projects I’m building using AI

Thanks for visiting!
