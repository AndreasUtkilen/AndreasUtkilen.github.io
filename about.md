# About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a curious learner on a mission to explore the world of Artificial Intelligence, one experiment at a time.

This blog is where I document my journey through the ELEC4630 and [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) courses and other AI-related projects. I believe that the best way to learn is by doingâ€”and sharing. So here you'll find my notes, code, reflections, and occasional rants about things that broke and how I fixed them. ðŸ˜…

## What I'm Learning

- Deep Learning (via fastai and PyTorch)
- Computer Vision

## Why This Blog?

- To stay consistent with learning
- To reflect on what Iâ€™ve understood (or misunderstood)
- To help others who might be stuck on the same problems
